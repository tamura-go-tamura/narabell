# Final Single-Shape MVP Verification (2025-09-14)

## Purpose
Confirm that all legacy multi-card artifacts are removed or neutralized and only `shape` card logic remains active in code and docs.

## Checklist

### Code
- [x] Active card component: `CardComponent.tsx` (inline text editing for shape)
- [x] Preview components: `PreviewCard.tsx`, `NewPreviewCard.tsx` (shape-only)
- [x] Coordinate API: `dragCoordinates.ts` (single unified API)
- [x] Store: `boardStore.ts` (addCard always forces `shape`)
- [x] Types: `types/board.ts` only exports `CardType = 'shape'`
- [x] Removed legacy card components content (files kept empty for potential diff awareness):
  - `TextCard.tsx`
  - `ImageCard.tsx`
  - `ListCard.tsx`

### Tests
- [x] `dragCoordinates.test.ts` uses only unified API; no references to removed utilities or other card types

### Docs
- [x] `architecture.md` updated (single shape)
- [x] `project-overview.md` updated
- [x] `cleanup-legacy-removal.md` documents removed files
- [x] No remaining references in docs to Text/Image/List cards

### Grep Verification (Manual)
Performed searches for: `TextCard`, `ImageCard`, `ListCard`, `case 'text'`, `case 'image'`, `case 'list'` in `src/` â€” only historical `.next` build artifacts matched; source code active paths clean.

### Remaining Artifacts
- Historical build outputs (`.next/`) still contain old code maps. Will be regenerated on next build; not an issue.
- Empty legacy component files intentionally retained (could be deleted entirely in a later cleanup PR).

## Decision
MVP state is consistent. Ready for tagging or deployment.
